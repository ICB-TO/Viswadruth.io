# PhD Student

All the cool kids had a GitHub page, so I decided to make one, too! I'm interested in figuring out why things work, especially with ML algorithms, as the inevitable march of Skynet gets closer.

My Journey so Far

## My research has spanned a few areas:

->Signal Processing: At the master's level, I worked with STFT, Wavelets, and Video Processing. My thesis was on "Enhancing Time Frequency Representations using Dual Basis Pursuit," advised by Prof. Ivan Selesnick.

->Microwave Communication: During my undergrad, I focused on Terahertz and Photonic Radars advised by Prof.T Rama Rao

->Future Networks: Currently, I'm a PhD student at SBU, advised by Professor Xin Wang, where I'm focused on the role of ML in future networks.

I was also involved with the Poeppel's lab at NYU, working on improving videoconferencing. I have internship experience at NIT Surathkal (CV for robotics) and Atos (ML pipelines for medical diagnostic systems).

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to research at the intersection of ML, Signal Processing, and networking.
